        Simon is an electronic game of memory skill invented by Ralph H. Baer
        and Howard J. Morrison, working for toy design firm Marvin Glass and
        Associates, with software programming by Lenny Cope. The device creates
        a series of tones and lights and requires a user to repeat the sequence.
        If the user succeeds, the series becomes progressively longer and more
        complex. Once the user fails or the time limit runs out, the game is
        over. The original version was manufactured and distributed by Milton
        Bradley and later by Hasbro after it took over Milton Bradley. Much of
        the assembly language code was written by Charles Kapps, who taught
        computer science at Temple University and also wrote one of the first
        books on the theory of computer programming. Simon was launched in 1978
        at Studio 54 in New York City and was an immediate success, becoming a
        pop culture symbol of the 1970s and 1980s.
